    "We are looking for people to help us Alpha test the Yellowbrick project! Helping is simple: simply create a notebook that applies the concepts in this getting started guide to a small to medium size data set of your choice. Run through the examples with the dataset, and try to change options and customize as much as possible. After you've exercised the code with your examples, respond to our alpha testing survey!\n",

    "Select a multivariate dataset of your own; the more datasets that we can run through Yellowbrick, the more likely we'll discover edge cases and exceptions! Note that the dataset must be well-suited to modeling with Scikit-Learn. In particular we recommend you choose a dataset whose target is suited to the following tasks:\n",

    "- [Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) (target is a continuous variable)\n",

If the data is also public (or you're willing to share it with the primary contributors) that will help us figure out bugs and required features much more easily! \n",
